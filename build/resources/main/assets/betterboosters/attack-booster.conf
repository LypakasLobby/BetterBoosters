# This Booster here has a few settings, each with its own toggleable/configuration options
# A side note: these settings are NOT used in player vs player battles, only player vs wild and player vs NPC battles

# Sets a blacklist of NPC locations, meaning the booster's functions will not activate for NPCs at these locations
# Typically useful for things like NPC Gyms or other challenging NPCs on the server so the player can't cheese them with booster stuff
# In "world,x,y,z" format

# It is up to you, the server owner, to make sure they don't have more than one permission in this map
