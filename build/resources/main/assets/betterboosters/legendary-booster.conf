# A brief explanation:
# The best thing I can think of to do with this booster was to apply a chance to spawn a legendary on players with the booster activated
# This is due to BetterBoosters being a mod designed to give individual players temporary perks
# Boosters can be activated globally for all players, sure, and so a booster needs to be able to be used individually and globally without one
#     function breaking the other/making the other completely useless
# So while it may be more balanced for server economy to do something like make the default legendary spawner run faster or have a higher chance to spawn,
# doing that would be more of a global-specific perk instead of a player specific perk.
# On the other hand, making the booster have a higher chance at spawning a legendary on a player with the booster active when the natural spawner runs would be
#     rendered useless if activated globally, because then all players would have the increased spawn chance making the booster's effect useless
# And even then both of those options relies on Pixelmon's default legendary spawner, which runs like - what - once every 2 hours?
# You'd have to have this booster activated for really long periods of time and even then it may end up doing nothing the entire time its activated

# So ultimately what I decided to do with this was just pop a small chance that a legendary gets spawned like a normal Pokemon on a player with the booster currently active
#     as long as the player is in a biome that naturally can spawn a legendary
# This effect works both individually and globally without making one or the other useless
# It also doesn't rely on Pixelmon's default spawner so you don't have to have like 4 hour timers on it for it to actually do something

# Sets the chance that the Legendary Booster activates its code
Chance=0.0001
# If true, will lock a legendary spawned by the Legendary Booster to the player that it was spawned for - to prevent stealing and shit
Lock-To-Player=true
# Sets how long the booster stays activated, in seconds, per permission node
# "default" is, well, default, auto applies to all players if no other permission check goes through
# If a player has more than one permission in this map, the first check that passes will be the timer value they get
# It is up to you, the server owner, to make sure they don't have more than one permission in this map
Timer {
  "default"=600
